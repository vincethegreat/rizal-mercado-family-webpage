    <p>Rizal arrived in Manila, accompanied by his
        sister Lucia on the 26th of June, 1892. Like
        the heroes of old, he was awaited by a crowd,
        watching or spying on him, before he was
        consecrated to history. The carabineers,
        headed by their commandant, a captain and
        lieutenant of the Guardia Civil Veterana, and
        a sergeant in civilian clothes were there.</p>
